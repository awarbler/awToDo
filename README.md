To Do List in Django
# Overview

<!-- {Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.} -->

I create a To Do List in Django using Djangos database to store my list of to dos for the day. 

<!-- {Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.} -->

My website is five pages. The main page holds the list. On the main page you may add, delete, and edit the database. The database is held on the the local drive that django provides. 

<!-- {Describe your purpose for writing this software.} -->
The purpose to write this To Do List is to help me track the items I need to do. 

<!-- {Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.} -->
